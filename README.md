# ice-cover-regression

This program uses machine learning to predict the ice coverage of Lake Mendota.

The data is the dates and durations of full-freeze ice covers on the Mendota lake, which can be found <a href="http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/lakes/Mendota-ice.html">here</a>. The program performs linear regression and standard gradient descent to predict the ice coverage of the coming year.
